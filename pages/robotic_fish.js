            <p className="text-xl leading-normal text-gray-700">
              During the final year of my undergraduate studies at Tallinn University of Technology, I joined the Center for Biorobotics, an institute dedicated to research at the intersection of biology and engineering. My fascination with animal social dynamics‚Äîparticularly how fish follow a leader in group behavior‚Äîled me to explore an engineering perspective:
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl leading-normal text-gray-700 font-semibold pl-4 border-l-4 border-accent my-8">
            üêü What makes a fish a leader? What physical and behavioral characteristics influence which individuals get followed?
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl leading-normal text-gray-700">
              To investigate these questions, I set out to design and build a robotic fish‚Äîa mechanical "carrier" fish capable of leading real fish by mimicking the qualities of an effective leader. This project became my undergraduate Mechatronics BSc thesis at Budapest University of Technology.

            <p className="text-xl leading-normal text-gray-700">
              Creating a life-like robotic fish required a departure from traditional rigid-body robotics. Instead of using fixed joints and motors, I developed a flexible-body design, incorporating a novel silicon-polymer material to create a compliant, undulating tail.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl leading-normal text-gray-700">
              However, modeling the fluid dynamics of a soft-bodied robot proved exceptionally complex. Fish-body interactions with water are highly nonlinear, making it difficult to simulate and predict movement mathematically. Instead, I followed an iterative design approach, refining each prototype based on real-world testing.

              The end product was a fully functional robotic fish that successfully demonstrated biologically inspired swimming. By using force sensors, I measured the propulsion efficiency, comparing its performance to other robotic fish designs from that era.
