                  Hello! I'm Eszter, an entrepreneur, designer, and engineer exploring the intersection of technology, human movement, and interactive design.
                </p>

                <p>
                  My work spans hardware, AI, and wearables, from motion-tracking sensors for weightlifting to responsive textiles and AI-driven fitness platforms. I focus on the balance between innovation and functionality, designing products that enhance human performance and experience.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Born in Hungary, I built a strong foundation in mathematics and engineering, which I've applied across fieldsâ€”from biomechanics and robotics to smart materials and connected fitness. My early years as a nationally ranked fin-swimmer (No. 8 in Hungary) instilled in me a disciplined, problem-solving mindset, shaping how I approach product development, creative technology, and business strategy.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Currently, I lead Notch, a motion-capture company redefining how athletes track and optimize movement, while also exploring food innovation and biotech through my latest venture. I'm passionate about turning ideas into reality, whether through cutting-edge sports tech, interactive installations, or futuristic nutrition solutions.
                </p>

                <p>
                  If you're interested in collaborating, exploring new technologies, or rethinking the future of human performance, feel free to reach out!

                  Co-Founder & CTO, Notch Wearable Motion Sensors (2013 - ) 
                </h3>
                <p className="text-m leading-normal text-gray-700 mb-4">
                As the Co-founder and CTO of Notch, I am leading the development of cutting-edge wearable motion sensors that redefine how human movement is captured and analyzed. Notch's multi-sensor system provides high-fidelity 3D motion data, delivering real-time, AI-powered insights on movement form, velocity, range of motion, fatigue, and performance â€” impacting fitness, rehabilitation, and healthcare.
                <br /><br />I oversee the technological vision of the company, from hardware development - selecting the best gyroscopes, accelerometers, BLE chips-, to AI-driven analytics, bridging biomechanics, machine learning, and user experience. My role extends across R&D, prototyping, manufacturing, and scaling production, ensuring that Notch remains at the forefront of motion tracking innovation.
